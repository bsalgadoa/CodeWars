# CodeWars

Hi there!

As you know i'm a self learner and a career change and this repo is my path throughout CodeWars katas!
<br>Each one of the files has my solution and some notes or comments.
<br>This helps me keep the pace, code on a daily basis, and improve as a developer.
<br>If you check them you'll see my method and how I think trough the problems.

HOWEVER, and this is IMPORTANT, please do not use them to cheat on the platform! 
   * Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at any solutions to Kata (mine included) until they have completed it themselves.
   * Codewars is a great way to practice and learn, and the rank and honor that you have, mean that you really worked for that.
   * I'm aware that creating a repository like this is discouraged by Codewars and I'm only sharing it to show my effort and method as a self-learner!

know that you'll not use them too cheat..
<br>..we're always learning so if you have a better approach or solution, I would love to hear it and learn from you!

Feel free to check them out and reach me!
